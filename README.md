# House Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict housing prices based on geographical location, median income, and housing attributes. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file (`housing.csv`) and consists of columns such as `longitude`, `latitude`, `housing_median_age`, `total_rooms`, and `median_house_value`.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps:
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is read from a CSV file.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The first few rows of the dataset are displayed to understand the structure.
3. **Modeling**: (Further steps on model training and evaluation are expected in the notebook).
